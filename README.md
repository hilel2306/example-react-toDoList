This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# TODOLIST EXAMPLE

## Before the code

First of all, before to talk about code, what is the principle of a to do list ? We want to be able to add tasks, to read the tasks, to mark the tasks as done, and delete them.

## What we need for this ?

We need to get the task entered by the user. We can use an input and this input is a state we can update the value.
We need to store the tasks entered by the user. We can use an array and this array is a state we can update the value.
We need to declarate the functions to :

- Add a task
- Mark the task as done
- Delete the task

## How it works ?

Each times the user is writing in the input, we udpate the value input state.
When the user click on the button "Ajouter une tâche", the function "handleAdd" is called, so we _push_ the task in the _array tasks_ and we return each task of the _array tasks_ like a list. If the user click on a task, the function "handleDone" is called, this task is marked as done or not if this task is already done. If the user click on the cross, the function "handleRemove" is called and the task is deleted.
